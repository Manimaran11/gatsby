## Breaking Changes

If you're looking for an overview of all breaking changes and how to migrate, please see the [migrating from v2 to v3 guide](/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/).

## Incremental Builds in OSS

Gatsby v2 introduced experimental "Conditional Page Builds" (enabled by `GATSBY_EXPERIMENTAL_PAGE_BUILD_ON_DATA_CHANGES` environment variable). It had some gotchas and quirks and wasn't ready yet for GA. With Gatsby v3 we improved this feature, and activated it by default for everyone! So incremental builds is available in OSS now. This improvement is (re)generating only subset of HTML files that needs to be generated. To be able to use it you will need to keep to `.cache` and `public` directories from previous builds.

Take a project powered by Shopify as an example. You have your listing of all products and then individual product pages -- when you change one single product, only that page should be rebuilt. In the screenshot below you can see exactly that (the sentence "Hello World" was added to the description):

![Side-by-side view of a Shopify store instance on the left, and the preview on the right. At the bottom the terminal shows that after the change only one page was rebuilt](./incremental-builds-in-oss.jpg)

The screenshot is taken from a lengthy video about Gatsby v3 at [GatsbyConf](https://gatsbyconf.com/). You can view the video showcasing this feature on YouTube there.

(when a new page is added and/or when something that was used to generate HTML files changed since last build)

### How does it work?

Gatsby tracks "inputs" used to generate HTML file and when those change since last build, HTML file is marked to be regenerated (if they don't change we can reuse HTML files generated in previous build). In particular we track:

- which page template page is using
- result of page query
- results of static queries used by a page template
- frontend source code (shared and also browser (`gatsby-browser`) / SSR (`gatsby-ssr`) specifically)

### Gotchas

As we mentioned, Gatsby tracks "inputs" used to generate HTML file. However, `gatsby-ssr` file allows some arbitrary code execution. This includes for example `fs` reads. While Gatsby could also track files that are read, the custom code that does those reads might have some special logic that Gatsby is not aware of. If Gatsby discovers that those are used, it will disable Incremental Builds mode to stay on the safe side (there will be warnings mentioning "unsafe builtin method").

If your `gatsby-ssr` (either site itself or plugin) make use of FS reads, head over to [migrating from v2 to v3 guide](/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/#using-fs-in-SSR) and check how to migrate.

## Fast Refresh

After adding our initial Fast Refresh integration back in November 2020, we worked on it over the last couple of releases. For Gatsby v3 we further improved usability, reliability, and accessibility to make it the default overlay. With this the old `react-hot-loader` is removed and you can benefit from all the new features it has: Fast Refresh is faster, handles errors better, and preserves state across re-renders.

Here's a preview:

![Three error overlays from left to right: Compile error, GraphQL errors, and runtime errors](./compile-graphql-runtime-errors.jpg)

We built a custom error overlay that aims to give you helpful information to fix your bugs more quickly. It features:

- A clear indication whether it's a runtime error, compile error, or GraphQL error
- Source code snippets that you can open in your editor with the press of a button
- The exact error location, including the original line and column
- The overlay automatically goes away once you fix the error

We also added two new ESLint rules inside the default configuration that will warn you against anti-patterns in your code:

- No anonymous default exports
- Page templates must only export one default export (the page) and `query` as a named export

## `babel-preset-gatsby`

`babel-preset-gatsby` now accepts `reactImportSource` which is passed to the underlying `@babel/preset-react` importSource field. Note that this field is only supported when `reactRuntime` is `automatic`, it is `classic` by default.

Configuration looks like this.

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "babel-preset-gatsby",
      {
        "reactRuntime": "automatic",
        "reactImportSource": "@emotion/react"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## ESLint

Gatsby no longer uses the deprecated `eslint-loader`, we've moved to `eslint-webpack-plugin`.

## Miscellaneous changes in plugins

### `gatsby-transformer-remark`

When using the `tableOfContents` functionality, the defaults have changed. `absolute` now defaults to `false` and `pathToSlugField` defaults to an empty string.

### `gatsby-react-router-scroll`

`ScrollContainer`, previously deprecated, has now been removed. Please use the `useScrollRestoration`hook instead.
